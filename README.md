Expanding the MC-GC template developed by Saghatelyan et al (2005)

The template developed by Saghatelyan et al (2005) includes one MC and one GC. We will modify the template to include dendritic Ca dynamics and copy the template to create a model network of 50 MCs and 400 GCs. We will then investigate the synchronization properties of this network as a function of GC excitability. We will also investigate the relative contributions of GC spike-dependent and spike-independent (graded) inhibition of MCs to the global synchronization.

Modifications to the original model:
1) Incorporate Ca channels into the GC dendritic template
2) Model graded inhibition of MCs
3) Create network of 50 MCs and 400 GCs connected with NetCon
